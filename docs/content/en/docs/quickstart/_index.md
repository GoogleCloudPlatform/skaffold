Follow this tutorial to learn about Skaffold on a small Kubernetes app built with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) inside [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io)
and deployed with [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)! 

{{< alert title="Note">}}
Aside from `Docker` and `kubectl`, Skaffold also supports a variety of other tools
and workflows; see [Tutorials]({{<relref "/docs/tutorials">}}) for
more information.
{{</alert>}}

In this quickstart, you will:

* Install Skaffold,
* Download a sample go app,
* Use `skaffold dev` to build and deploy your app every time your code changes,
* Use `skaffold run` to build and deploy your app once, similar to a CI/CD pipeline

## Before you Begin

* [Install Skaffold]({{< relref "/docs/install" >}})
* [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [Install minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

{{< alert title="Note">}}
Skaffold will build the app using the Docker daemon hosted inside minikube. 
If you want to deploy against a different Kubernetes cluster, e.g. Kind, GKE clusters, you will have to install Docker to build this app.
{{</alert>}}

## Downloading the Sample App

1. Clone the Skaffold repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold
    ```

1. Change to the `examples/getting-started` directory.

    ```bash
    cd examples/getting-started
    ```

## `skaffold dev`: Continuous Build & Deploy on Code Changes

Run `skaffold dev` to build and deploy your app continuously.
You should see some outputs similar to the following entries:

```

```

`skaffold dev` watches your local source code and executes your Skaffold pipeline
every time a change is detected. `skaffold.yaml` provides specifications of the
workflow - in this example, the pipeline is

* Building a Docker image from the source using the Dockerfile
* Tagging the Docker image with the `sha256` hash of its contents
* Updating the Kubernetes manifest, `k8s-pod.yaml`, to use the image built previously
* Deploying the Kubernetes manifest using `kubectl apply -f`
* Streaming the logs back from the deployed app

Let's re-trigger the workflow just by a single code change!
Update `main.go` as follows:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	for {
		fmt.Println("Hello Skaffold!")
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
	}
}
```

When you save the file, Skaffold will see this change and repeat the workflow described in
`skaffold.yaml`, rebuilding and redeploying your application. Once the pipeline
is completed, you should see the changes reflected in the output in the terminal:

```
[getting-started] Hello Skaffold!
```

## `skaffold run`: Build & Deploy Once 

If you prefer building and deploying once at a time, run `skaffold run`.
Skaffold will perform the workflow described in `skaffold.yaml` exactly once.
