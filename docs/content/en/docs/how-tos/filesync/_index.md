This page discusses how to set up file sync for files that don't require full rebuild.

File sync is alpha and may change between releases.

Skaffold supports copying changed files to a deployed containers so as to avoid the need to
rebuild, redeploy, and restart the corresponding pod.  The file copying is enabled
by adding a `sync` section with _sync rules_ to the `artifact` in the `skaffold.yaml`.

The following example will cause any changes to JavaScript files under the _context_ directory
to be copied to the deployed container into the container's `WORKDIR`.

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v1beta8
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: gcr.io/k8s-skaffold/node-example
    context: node
    sync:
      '.filebaserc': .
      '*.html': static
      '**/*.png': assets
      '***/*.md': content
```
A double-asterisk (`**/`) applies recursively to all subdirectories but flattens the result,
stripping the subdirectory structure.
A triple-asterisk (`***/`) applies recursively to all subdirectories but retains
the subdirectory structure.  

Under the hood, Skaffold monitors and creates a tar file with changed files that match
the sync rules.  This tar file is sent and extracted on the corresponding containers. 

### Limitations

File sync has some limitations:

  - File sync requires the `tar` command to be available in the container.
  - Only local source files can be synchronized: files created by the builder will not be copied.
