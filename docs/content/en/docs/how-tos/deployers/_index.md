This page discusses how to set up Skaffold to use the tool of your choice
to deploy your app to a Kubernetes cluster.

When Skaffold deploys an application the following steps happen: 

* the Skaffold deployer _renders_ the final kubernetes manifests: Skaffold replaces the image names in the kubernetes manifests with the final tagged image names. 
Also, in case of the more complicated deployers the rendering step involves expanding templates (in case of helm) or calculating overlays (in case of kustomize). 
* the Skaffold deployer _deploys_ the final kubernetes manifests to the cluster

Skaffold supports the following tools for deploying applications:

* [`kubectl`](#deploying-with-kubectl) 
* [Helm](#deploying-with-helm) 
* [kustomize](#deploying-with-kustomize)

The `deploy` section in the Skaffold configuration file, `skaffold.yaml`,
controls how Skaffold builds artifacts. To use a specific tool for deploying
artifacts, add the value representing the tool and options for using the tool
to the `build` section. For a detailed discussion on Skaffold configuration,
see [Skaffold Concepts: Configuration](/docs/concepts/#configuration) and
[Skaffold.yaml References](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/blob/master/examples/annotated-skaffold.yaml).

## Deploying with kubectl

`kubectl` is Kubernetes
[command-line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
for deploying and managing
applications on Kubernetes clusters.

Skaffold can work with `kubectl` to
deploy artifacts on any Kubernetes cluster, including
[Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
clusters and local [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) clusters.

To use `kubectl`, add deploy type `kubectl` to the `deploy` section of
`skaffold.yaml`.

The `kubectl` type offers the following options:

{{< schema root="deploy.kubectl" >}}

The following `deploy` section, for example, instructs Skaffold to deploy
artifacts using `kubectl`:

{{% readfile file="samples/deployers/kubectl.yaml" %}}

## Deploying with Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you
manage Kubernetes applications. Skaffold can work with Helm by calling its
command-line interface.

To use Helm with Skaffold, add deploy type `helm` to the `deploy` section
of `skaffold.yaml`.

The `helm` type offers the following options:

{{< schema root="deploy.helm" >}}

Each release includes the following fields:

{{< schema root="deploy.helm.releases" >}}

The following `deploy` section, for example, instructs Skaffold to deploy
artifacts using `helm`:

{{% readfile file="samples/deployers/helm.yaml" %}}

## Deploying with kustomize

[kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) allows Kubernetes
developers to customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes.
Skaffold can work with `kustomize` by calling its command-line interface.

To use kustomize with Skaffold, add deploy type `kustomize` to the `deploy`
section of `skaffold.yaml`. 

The `kustomize` type offers the following options:

{{< schema root="deploy.kustomize" >}}

The following `deploy` section, for example, instructs Skaffold to deploy
artifacts using kustomize:

{{% readfile file="samples/deployers/kustomize.yaml" %}}
